sprai for Debian
----------------

The ezez*.pl scripts can also be called without
the .pl suffix in this package, but this is currently Debian-specific.

Any remaining scripts and commands that come with Sprai can be found
in /usr/lib/sprai. Most of them are only useful internally by the software,
but everything is there should you need to use them directly.
