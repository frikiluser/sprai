sprai for Debian
----------------

The upstream build system is waf, which needs to be repacked for Debian
standards. Using gbp import-orig does not work right, as the repack-waf
script doesn't get run and you end up with the waf binary in the source
distribution. Instead, manually call uscan, then use gbp to import the
resulting repacked tarball.
